# changemyview-llm

This repository houses a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app that employs [`praw`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)—Reddit's Python API wrapper—in conjunction with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) GPT-4 models to retrieve posts from the [r/changemyview](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/) subreddit and generate AI-powered responses.

As an exercise, we instruct GPT-4 to concoct a counter argument no matter the position of the original poster.

You can use the public version on the [Streamlit Cloud](https://mr-devs-changemyview-llm-appstreamlit-app-banmjd.streamlit.app/).
